### TU Delft Logo Inclusion

The extension automatically includes the TU Delft logo by default. You can control this behavior:

```yaml
# Include the TU Delft logo (default: true)
institute-logo-tudelft: true  

# Add additional logos
institute-logos:
  - path: "images/partner-institute-logo.png"
  - path: "images/another-institute-logo.png"
```

To disable the automatic inclusion of the TU Delft logo:

```yaml
institute-logo-tudelft: false
```

When providing your own logos, the TU Delft logo (if enabled) will always appear first, followed by your specified logos.

### Multiple Institute Logos

To include multiple logos of institutions that contributed to your research:

```yaml
institute-logos:
  - path: "images/tudelft-logo.png"
    spacing: "1.5cm"  # Optional spacing between logos
  - path: "images/partner-institute-logo.png"
```

Alternatively, for a single logo, you can use the simpler syntax:

```yaml
institute-logo: "images/tudelft-logo.png"
```
